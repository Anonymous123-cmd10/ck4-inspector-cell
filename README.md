A blueprint for an engineered macrophage-based sentinel cell for early threat detection, triage, and structured immune reporting.

# CK4- Inspector Cell â€“ Engineering Blueprint

> A synthetically engineered myeloid cell (macrophage chassis) for continuous tissue surveillance, multi-modal threat detection, and graded immune escalation.

## ðŸ“– Overview
The CK4- Inspector Cell is a conceptual design for a dedicated immune sentinel capable of:
- **Patrolling** peripheral tissues with biased dwell time at barrier surfaces.
- **Integrating** multi-input signals (MHC anomaly, stress, PAMPs/DAMPs, local consensus).
- **Executing graded responses**: TAG (recruit innate cells), CALL_TRAP (local containment), ESCALATE (adaptive activation).
- **Operating safely** with built-in activation budgets, drug-induced suicide switches, and audit logs.

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Sensing â†’ Computation â†’ Reporting â†’ Safety.
- **Mathematical Detection Core**: Temporal integration of threat scores with tun thresholds.
- **Structured Reporting**: Engineered exosomes (PKTs) with minigene mRNA + barcode proteins.
- **Macrophage Chassis**: Leverages native biological fitness and metabolic plasticity.
